## What is it?

You wake up in a cramped ship cockpit with your AI companion NOVA, empty fuel tanks, and a growing realization that your "routine" smuggling career just became the most dangerous job in the galaxy. Those sealed crates you've been hauling? They contain the **Infinity Stones**—six cosmic artifacts that could reshape reality itself.

Now everyone wants a piece of you: the Federation (to arrest you), the Cartel (to kill you), and cosmic entities (to use you). Your choices will determine not just your survival, but the fate of the universe.

**Will you deliver the stones and doom the universe? Sell them for wealth? Or ascend to godhood?**

## Core Gameplay

**Contracts**: Accept cargo runs with three types of crates:
- Legit (safe, boring)
- Illicit (illegal, profitable) 
- Sealed (mystery—could be anything, including Infinity Stones)

**Heat System**: Your galaxy wide "wanted level" -- push your luch, but remember: high heat = more police, harder bribes, deadlier encounters.

**Fuel Management**: Every sector costs fuel. Prices fluctuate. Run out = game over.

**Daily Actions**: Choose ONE per day:
- Travel (progress toward destination)
- Lay Low (reduce heat, waste time)
- Use Items (heal, prepare)

## Endings

**DENIAL**: Earn 1M credits, retire rich, ignore the cosmic apocalypse

**STALEMATE**: Keep all stones out of play - you balanced the scales, but nobody thanks you

**GODHOOD**: Collect all 6 stones, reshape reality itself

**MARTYR**: Destroy all stones, save the universe at the cost of your life

**HARBINGER**: Deliver all stones: congrats, your name goes down in history as the fool who brought Him the keys to destroy everything
