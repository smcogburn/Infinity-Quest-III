# Infinity Quest III: Smuggler's Gambit

A fast-paced, text-based space smuggling roguelike where every decision could be your last.

## What is it?

You're a Han Solo-style smuggler who accidentally becomes the galaxy's most wanted. Turns out those "routine cargo runs" contain the six Infinity Stones. Now the Federation wants to arrest you, the Cartel wants to kill you, and cosmic forces are watching.

**Will you deliver the stones and doom the universe? Sell them for wealth? Or ascend to godhood?**

Perfect for quick sessions—start during a break, die spectacularly (or retire rich) before it ends.

## Core Gameplay

**Contracts**: Accept cargo runs with three types of crates:
- Legit (safe, boring)
- High-Value (illegal, profitable) 
- Sealed (mystery—could be anything, including Infinity Stones)

**Heat System**: Illegal activities raise your wanted level. High heat = more police, harder bribes, deadlier encounters.

**Fuel Management**: Every sector costs fuel. Prices fluctuate. Run out = game over.

**Daily Actions**: Choose ONE per day:
- Travel (progress toward destination)
- Lay Low (reduce heat, waste time)
- Use Items (heal, prepare)

## Endings

**DENIAL**: Earn 1M credits, retire rich, ignore the cosmic apocalypse

**COMPROMISE**: Keep all stones out of play—you balanced the scales but nobody thanks you

**GODHOOD**: Collect all 6 stones, reshape reality itself

**MARTYR**: Destroy all stones, save the universe at the cost of your life

**HARBINGER**: Deliver all stones—congrats, you just handed cosmic keys to a madman

## Ship Upgrades

- **Speed**: Travel multiple sectors, better escapes
- **Cargo**: More crates = bigger payouts
- **Fuel Tank**: Extended range

Costs scale exponentially—spend wisely.

## Infinity Stones

Each stone grants unique powers but increases your heat:
- Space: Skip hazards
- Mind: Know success chances
- Reality: Re-roll failures  
- Soul: Cheat death once
- Time: Take extra actions
- Power: [Various combat bonuses]
