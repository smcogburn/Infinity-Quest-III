Infinity Quest III PLAN


Series recap.

Infinity Quest I (2023) was a no‑graphics text roguelike: players hop between random space events to gather six Infinity Stones. It’s famous for its brutal luck—one bad roll ends the run—and for lightning‑fast, “spam‑Enter” pacing.

Infinity Quest II (2024): Swag Messiah was a RPG graphic novel, centered on exploring the universe, dialouge focus / branching endings. it experimented with different mechanics and never quite stuck the landing.

Infinity Quest III (2025): Smuggler's Cambit returns to the unfair‑but‑addictive roots, but reframes the objective: you’re a Han‑Solo‑style smuggler, not a hero (or are you?).


Return to Infiniy Quest I:
  Same one‑roll lethal stakes; the “Press Enter to reveal” pause is back.
Memorable flavor text, meme‑tier quotes, and unfair event chains still make runs talk‑worthy.
Stones remain the wildcard—but now you discover them mid‑smuggle rather than hunting them outright.

Players should be able to:
Start a fresh run during a study hall, die spectacularly (or retire filthy rich) before the bell.
Trash‑talk friends over seeds: “I cracked the Sealed crate day two—Time Stone, baby, sub‑15‑minute run!”
Feel real agency: every Lay‑Low or Pocket Stone click is a genuine gamble.

Premise:
  You’re a Han‑Solo‑style runner hauling mystery cargo across cartel space. Six packages turn out to be the Infinity Stones. Decide whether to deliver them, flip them on the black market, or keep them and risk becoming a cosmic target.

  Win paths 
    Godhood - keep all stones (this is the riskest path, police and cartels hunt you constatly)

    Kingpin - earn 1m credits and retire (but the universe ends is at odds)
        Prompt to retire once you surpass 1m credits, or you can keep playing

    Tycoon - all stones are out of play (pocketed OR delivered, less than 1m credits, universe still at odds)

    Accomplice - you delivered all 6 stones (The universe collapses into his fist. Your name goes down in history as the fool who brought him the keys)

  Lose conditions
   You die 

  Stats
    Player HP
    Hull (ship health)
    Fuel (ship fuel)
    Speed (how fast ur ship is, reduces travel time)
    Hold (cargo slots + which ones are filled)
    Heat (how much police/cartel attention, leads to increase chance for the ecounters to happen, make it harder to bribe, more police units, more cartel members etc - affects flavor text - different names of ships, bounty hunters, police units, etc.)
    Credits (how much money)
    Stones (stones you hold)
    Inventory (other stuff to sell - marked contraband vs. not)

YOU START AT A TRADE HUB - ORIGIN AND END POINT FOR CONTRACTS
  Refuel, buy stuff, etc.

  Accept Contracts
    Board shows (random amount) of offers
    Each offer has 1-X amount of crates (X is how many ur ship can hold)
        Each crate - random chance to be different tier (each one is worth more + higher chance to contain stone)
            Legit (normal stuff)
            High-Value (illegal goods)
            Sealed (you dont know - could be legit, could be super illegal)


  Daily loop
    Deadline for delivery contract timer goes down
      if it hits zero and u didnt deliver it - the cartel jumps you - major a fight, if you win you pocket all the cargo (all crates get opened, stuff added to inventory)
    Check if you ran out of fuel
    Player Action (choose ONE)
      Travel (consume 1 Fuel, progress 1 sector IF CONTRACT ACTIVE; Speed ≥ 3 lets you roll twice and keep lower hazard)
      Lay Low (Heat −3, but no progress torwards goal)
    Random Encounter (single d20)
      Police patrol (or cartel) (high heat increases chance + amount of them)
        12 gets behind your spaceship on the highway
          1. run
            they shoot at you (damage done to ur ship)
            get away (increase chance if ur ship is faster, heat goes up)
            they catch you (proceed to encounter)
          2. stop
          encounter
            bribe (chance of working or not)
            if not then they search your ship
            random chance if they find each crate or not
            if they do find it
            legit are always safe
            high value are always contraband
            sealed its a random chance safe or not (but you find out whats inside the crate)
            they take confiscate contraband
            either way heat -1
      Asteroid / hazard
        go around / reroute - lose days and fuel
        go through - risk (make it through or get hit, ship loses health)
      Trade Hub (good planet) - Choose to land, repairs, fuel, sell legal loot, new contracts (IF U DONT HAVE A CURRENT ONE), police search when landing (high heat = automatic arrest attempt)
      Black Market (evil planet) - high heat = cartel fight
        Choose to land
        Heat goes up for landing
        Crack open sealed crates
        Sell contraband
      Tractor Beam / mothership (star wars)
        Can try to escape the tractor beam (might fail) or choose to let it pull you in
        its like a dungeon (same as last game)
        on enter - encounter
        after that - certain amount of rooms, keep exploring or leave at any time
        could be jumped at any moment
        boss fight??
        other story details??
        different ones - galactic federation, cartel, prison, etc.
        find money, upgrades, loot, etc.
        Heat goes up 

    IF you have arrived at destination - delivery phase
      all crates pop open , items revealed
      You can then choose to STEAL the haul
      Immediate cartel fight, heat goes up a lot
      choose to accept a new quest
      then you go to regular trade hub experience
    
      Each stone you carry automatically gives you heat (like +5)

    Day end
      Update blaance and money
      Heat goes down 1 if you ddint do anthing illegal
      
    

  Stone powers
    Space - can choose to skip hazard roll when traveling in space
    Mind - read minds of others (know chances before you pick choice)
    Reality - re-roll failed result
    Power - ??
    Soul - cheat death once
    Time - take a second action

    Brief news updates every day based on your actions
    Lotta Flavor text
        "The client smiled oddly as they examined the contents..."
        a new day begins, etc.
        etc.
    
    Minimal graphics
        Current Day

        Sector map (like a GPS - if no active quest, not there)
        [HUB]---[*]---[*]---[?]---[DEST]
                ^YOU

        SHIP DISPLAY
        Like a diagram of the ship + each cargo hold

        ASCII status bars - 
        HULL: [██████░░░░] 60%  FUEL: [████████░░] 80%  HEAT: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

        Then your stats
        Your inventory
